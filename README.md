# Infinite Scale Experiment

This is an experiments in design about how to develop applications
when operating at _near infinite scale_. This is based of off a [white-
paper][1] from Amazon by Pat Helland.

Nothing in this is _"production ready"_ and should be taken for what it is,
an experiment. If you have any fun thoughts or questions about any of this,
feel free to email me `me at johnmurray dot io`.
